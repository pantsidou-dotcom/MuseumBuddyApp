# Environment Cleanup Status

- [x] Updated `.gitignore` to block all environment files while preserving `.env.example`.
- [x] Removed `.env.local` from version control.
- [ ] Rewrite repository history (requires `git filter-repo` or BFG; blocked here because the tooling cannot be downloaded behind the proxy).
- [ ] Rotate exposed environment keys directly in Vercel and any other affected services.

> **Note:** The remaining tasks must be completed with access to the production GitHub repository and the Vercel project settings.
